# Introduction #

Gene Expression Programming is a type of Generic Algorithm.This project is a free tool which uses Gene Expression Programming Algorithm to discover the functions or rules from large dataset. It is a smart tool to do the data mining task. The typical usage is mining the functions from the dataset.

freeGEP is a free and much simple tool which contains the main framework of GEP algorithm. It is easy to use and also allow people easily plugin their own methods or gene operators into the source code of freeGEP to build their own GEP tool.
