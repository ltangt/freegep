Gene Expression Programming is a type of Generic Algorithm. This project is to provide a free tool using Gene Expression Programming Algorithm to discover the functions or rules from large datasets. The typical usage is mining complex or non-linear regression functions to predict the target values.To see about the GEP Algorithm, please visit this website: http://www.gene-expression-programming.com/.
freeGEP is simple python implementation of the GEP algorithm. It is easy to use and also allow people easily plugin their own methods or gene operators into the source code of freeGEP to build their own GEP algorithm.
